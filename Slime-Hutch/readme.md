## Installation

DELETE any old slime hutch to menagerie mod.
Copy ```[CP] Slime Hutch to menagerie```into your mods folder.

## Credits

It is based on my favourite greenhouse mod [Wren's Expanded Greenhouse](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5431), and uses their assets for the window frames.

Also uses an asset from Farmhouses Enhanced by [wildzooey](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/52416251).

The water troughs are included but can also be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6453).
