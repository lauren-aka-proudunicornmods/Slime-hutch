# Readme

This is a repository for my Stardew Valley Mods, which are ONLY uploaded on Nexus here:

https://www.nexusmods.com/users/85570763?tab=user+files

I am not currently very active in modding, so, if you would like to contribute to or take over any mod, please let me know!

Feel free to use any of my code in your own projects, BUT please **don't use assets that I have borrowed from other authors without checking their permissions also**. You can find credits and permissions for each mod on its Nexus page.

## To do

See the issues page.
